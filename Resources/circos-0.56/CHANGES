Added to README for Windows users.

16 Jun 2011 v0.55-1

Multiple karyotype files can be specified as comma-delimited list in 'karyotype' parameter

Color for chromosomes can be specified with chromosomes_color
  hs1:red,hs2:blue,...

Chromosomes can now take a fraction of the entire image by specifying relative scale.
  hs1:0.25r # hs1 will take up 1/4 of the figure

Parameters in included configuration files can be overridden using "*" suffix. Any number of *s can be
used to indicate priority. 

  <ideogram>
  <<include ideogram.defaults.conf>>
  # this will override any 'label_radius'
  label_radius*   = dim(ideogram,radius) + 0.25r
  # this will override any 'label_radius', 'label_radius*', and 'label_radius**'
  label_radius*** = dim(ideogram,radius) + 0.25r
  </ideogram>

Parameter list can now use '=' for assignment, in addition to ':'. Lists that do not expect a span (e.g. chromosomes) can also use ',' as record delimiter. For example, any of these will work.

  chromosomes_scale = chr1:0.5;chr2:0.25
  chromosomes_scale = chr1:0.5,chr2:0.25
  chromosomes_scale = chr1=0.5;chr2=0.25
  chromosomes_scale = chr1=0.5,chr2=0.25

Transparent colors now include COLOR_a0, which points to the fully opaque version of COLOR. Thus, for a given auto_alpha_steps value (e.g. N=5) COLOR_a0 ... COLOR_aN are available. Previously COLOR_a0 was not available and the name COLOR had to be used (e.g. red instead of red_a0).

remap(value,min,max,remap_min,remap_max) can now be used in rules, as well as remap_int() to remap to integers (truncation) or remap_round() to remap to integers (rounding).

chromosomes_scale and chromosomes_color can accept regular expressions for chromosomes. These are evaluated first, followed by literal chromosome definitions.

  chromosomes_scale = /hs/=0.2,hs5=0.5,/hs1/=0.3

  order of scale adjustment:

  1. all chromosomes matching /hs/ set to 0.2
  2. all chromosomes matching /hs1/ set to 0.3
  3. hs5 set to 0.5

'chromosomes' parameter accepts regular expressions, specified using /.../

  chromosomes = /hs/
  chromosomes = -/hs/

When chrromosomes_display_default=yes, use chromosomes_order_by_karyotype=yes to order chrs by their order in the karyotype. If this parameter is not set, the order is determined by a sort based on string+digit in the chromosome name (e.g. chr1=chr+1 chr2=chr+2, etc)

Histograms with transparency fill should now no longer have an outline even if no outline is desired. This artefact was due to how GD rendered antialiased filled polygons.

Rules for links and plots can have 'use=no' to turn them off.

Color lists now written to cache to speed up color allocation at run-time.

Debug groups now available to show running status of components. See etc/housekeeping.conf for a full list
 
  e.g.
  summary   - summary progress
  chrfilter - ideogram filtering
  conf      - configuration
  ideogram  - ideogram reports
  cache     - file caching
  io        - file input/output
  _all      - turn on all debugging (very verbose)

Colors such as vlred (very light red), lred (light red), etc, have been replaced by Brewer palette colors, where possible. For example, the vlred, lred, red, dred, vdred samples the 5 color sequential red palette.

Multiple counters can be adjusted with pre_increment_counter and other functions using a comma-delimited list

  pre_increment_counter = counter1:10,counter2:15

Colors have always been forced to lowercase. If a user asked for a color with capitals (e.g. chrX), an error resulted. Now, only a warning is generated (if warnings are turned on) if the lowercase equivalent is found.

Parallel labels should now be better centered when using label_center for the ideogram label in <ideogram> block.

Added band_stroke_thickness to <ideogram> block.

init_counter is now used to initialize a counter value 

Added example/ and moved tutorials to a separate distribution.

Speeded up the text track.

Speeded up input io - data points that don't fall on ideograms on the figure are ignored

10 Sep 2011 v0.56-pre0

Parallel ideogram labels are now centered with respect to the ideogram.

restrict_parameter_names now controls whether parameters are restricted to a pre-defined list (e.g. color, thickness, etc). If you have custom parameters (e.g. 'myspecialcode') then set restrict_parameter_names=no. By default, this is always set to 'yes'.

Added link_orientation for text tracks. When set to "out" links from text labels face out, rather than in.

28 Oct 2011 v0.56-pre1

Added font names to SVG files via font-family tag. 

1 Nov 2011 v0.56-pre2

Removed -verbose. The -v flag now reports version.

Added -version.

Removed dependence on Graphics::ColorObject.

Added error handling framework. 

Circos now requires Text::Format

Bug fix to heat map color mapping of last color.

26 Jan 2012 v0.56-pre3

Fixed bug which was causing line links to be drawn with a thickness half of what was requested.

Fixed bug that prevented parameters made acceptable by the restrict_parameter_names=no setting from being parsed.

Configuration file location is now guessed if guess_conf_location=yes (see etc/housekeeping.conf)

Color file cache can now be static (color_cache_static) and dir/file can be changed (color_cache_{file,dir})

Added 'placed' and 'not_placed' output for labels in text tracks to. Use -debug_group text to see this.

   # create data file of labels that were not placed
   circos -conf ... -debug_group text | grep not_placed > text.notplaced.txt

Parts of the code were made faster (unit checking) through Memoize.

Fixed a bug which prevented links with thickness=1 from being shown with correct transparency.

4 Feb 2012 v0.56-pre4

Fixed bug in which color errors were produced when PNG file was not asked for.

Fixed bug in which opacity of links in SVG files was missing in some cases.

Fixed but which was assigning the wrong color to transparent links in PNG files in some cases.

Centralized color configuration files colors.conf now includes brewer.conf - no need to include brewer.conf separately.

Added -paranoid flag to exit on warnings.

Made error messages friendlier. Revamped internal error handling mechanism.

5 Feb 2012 v0.56

Added data_path to allow adding to locations where files are searched for.

Added data/ to prefix path of locations where files are searched for. Now the default search locations are

  { CWD | CIRCOS_PATH } + { . | .. | ../.. } + { . | etc | data }
